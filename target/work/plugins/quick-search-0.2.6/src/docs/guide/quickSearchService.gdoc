The Quick Search Service is responsible for the whole logic of search. It allows the search based on domain class persistent properties, embedded class properties as well as association properties. It provides two basic methods: search() for listing the results and searchAutoComplete() suitable for listing the results for autocomplete. For more information see [searchService|services].
