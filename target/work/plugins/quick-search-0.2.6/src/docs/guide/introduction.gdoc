The Quick Search Plugin is the search implementation suitable for querying one domain class in one query. It supports search of domain class persistent properties as well as embedded and association properties. It is best suited for backend search where the user would like to search in a certain list of domain class objects without specifying which properties should be used for which kind of search. The complex search could be acomplished using [Filter Pane Plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/filterpane].
